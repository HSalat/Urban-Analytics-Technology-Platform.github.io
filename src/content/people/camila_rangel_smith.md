Camila is a Research Data Scientist at The Alan Turing Institute. She holds a PhD in Particle Physics from Universit√© Paris Diderot where she worked on the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. During her PhD she participated on the discovery of the Higgs Boson particle announced by CERN in 2012. She continued working on ATLAS as a postdoc for Uppsala University where she focused on searches for physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics.

Right before joining the Turing, she worked as Data Scientist in the EdTech sector developing innovative products focused on the assessment process in education.
