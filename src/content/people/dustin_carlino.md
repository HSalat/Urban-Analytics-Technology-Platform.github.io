Dustin is a software engineer working to make transportation planning tools more widely accessible. He originally gained an interest in agent-based modelling and simulation from a background in creating computer games. He graduated from the undergraduate Computer Science program at the University of Texas at Austin. There he built a traffic simulation that allows a fleet of autonomous vehicles to participate in auctions to move through intersections more quickly. He then joined Google Cloud in Seattle, where he worked on backend systems for Google Compute Engine. In 2018, he started A/B Street, an open-source project to let interested citizens explore and propose changes to road networks to improve walking, cycling, and public transit. He joined the Urban Analytics team at The Alan Turing Institute in December 2021.
