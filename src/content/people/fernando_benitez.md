Fernando Benitez-Paez is a researcher in GIScience with a solid knowledge of remote sensing, holding a PhD in Geo-Informatics from the Department of Informatics at University Jaume I in Spain with the support of Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions. Since April 2021 he works as Research Associate at The Alan Turing Institute as part of the AI for science and government (ASG) initiative, particularly in the Shocks and Resilience project to develop spatial modelling methods that can be integrated within the epidemiologic-socio-economic models in order to tackle policy questions that are relevant at the sub-national level.

Previously he held a research fellowship at the University of Jaume I - Spain, supported by the Government of Spain and the European Social Fund (ESF). In 2019 he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, developing a novel data fusion method to annotate Earthâ€™s magnetic field data from satellite sources to GPS trajectories in collaboration with experts from the British Geological Survey - BGS.

Fernando has experience in the geospatial industry as a former development and business partner manager, and head of the geographic innovation team in Esri-Colombia supporting several local and national authorities in multiple countries, especially in Colombia and Spain. His main research interests include the science of movement ( human and animal), urban analytics, GIScience,  and data fusion methods.
