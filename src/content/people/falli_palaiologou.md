My background is in architecture and my research focuses on the urban design and city scales. My primary research domain is urban morphology, the study of urban form, through analytical approaches using spatial and empirical data. I am an expert in space syntax methodologies, having spent seven years in the UCL Space Syntax Laboratory for my doctoral and post-doctoral research, funded by EPSRC. I conduct research on sustainable urban transformations, focusing on urban streets and sidewalks, street liveability, placemaking and urban regeneration, temporary cities, the architecture of the ordinary, historical urban landscapes and sustainable urban heritage. I have presented my work in over a dozen conferences as well as in prestigious public venues such as the Royal Academy of Arts. In 2017, under the patronage of UNESCO, I led the organisation of HUL Forum, an international networking initiative on the UNESCO Historic Urban Landscape approach.

I am involved in several PhD supervisions in the Architecture Research Group on the topics of urban heritage and sustainable urban development; Ekistics and sustainable urbanism; urban morphology and green infrastructure; space syntax and disaster risk management. In addition, I conduct research in collaboration with the ABCE Transport Research Group on urban interventions for kerbspace in public spaces, funded by InnovateUK.
