Andy is a Research Data Scientist in the Turing's Research Engineering Group.

Before joining the Turing, he worked for a small charity who provide mapping and information management support to humanitarian operations for major international emergencies. Over the years, his roles included everything from fixing the printers to leading teams in post-disaster environments, juggling both the operational and analytical sides of the work.

Prior to that, he completed his PhD at Newcastle University, exploring flood risk in the UK, modelling the rainfall scenarios likely to cause the most widespread and damaging floods.
